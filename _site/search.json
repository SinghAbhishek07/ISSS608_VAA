Are participants with higher joviality more likely to spend or save money?\n\nThe city wants to use the information to help with its significant community development initiatives, particularly how to distribute a sizable grant for city renewal that it recently received it. This would make it possible for urban planners to concentrate their efforts on particular regions of the community to raise population merriment generally."

The range of IDs is from 0 to 1,010, indicating that there are no missing or duplicated IDs.\nhouseholdSize: The data contains three distinct household sizes: 1, 2, and 3. The most common household size is 2, followed by 1 and then 3. The proportions indicate that 33.3% of the households have a size of 1, 36.9% have a size of 2, and 29.8% have a size of 3.\nhaveKids: There are two distinct values: FALSE and TRUE. The majority of participants (70.2%) do not have kids, while 29.8% have kids.\nage: The data includes 43 distinct ages, ranging from 18 to 60. The mean age is approximately 39 years, with a standard deviation of 14.3. The 5th percentile is 20, the median is 39, and the 95th percentile is 58.\neducationLevel: There are four distinct education levels: Bachelors, Graduate, HighSchoolOrCollege, and Low. The majority of participants (51.9%) have a HighSchoolOrCollege education level, followed by Bachelors (22.9%), Graduate (16.8%), and Low (8.3%).\ninterestGroup: There are 10 distinct interest groups labeled from A to J. The frequencies and proportions indicate the distribution of participants across these interest groups.\njoviality: Joviality is a numeric variable ranging from 0 to 1. The mean joviality score is approximately 0.494, with a standard deviation of 0.3364. The 5th percentile is 0.05642, the median is 0.47754, and the 95th percentile is 0.96024.\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging Data Types:\n\nparticipantId is classified as <dbl>, numerical continuous data, instead of nominal. This is cast as <chr> class using as.factor()\nhouseholdSize is classified as <dbl>, but categorical in nature with different levels. This is cast as <chr> class using `as.factor()\neducationLevel is classified as <chr  > categorical data,which has 4 different category.

The participant ID ranges from 0 to 1,010. .\nTimestamp: The financial data spans a time period from March 1, 2022, to February 28, 2023. The timestamp variable shows the date and time of each financial transaction. .\nCategory: There are six distinct categories in the financial data, including Education, Food, Recreation, RentAdjustment, Shelter, and Wage. The most frequent category is Food, accounting for approximately 52.2% of the transactions, followed by Recreation (19.6%) and Wage (27.3%).\nAmount: The amount variable represents the monetary value of each transaction. The mean amount is 20.05, indicating an average transaction value. The range of the amounts is from -1562.726 to 4096.526, with a wide distribution. The majority of the amounts fall within the range of -21.050 to 159.561.\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging Data Types:\n\nparticipantId is classified as <dbl>, numerical continuous data, instead of nominal. This is cast as <chr> class using as.factor()\ntimestamp has a big value contains date and time both, which is not required for our anaylsis. So i will change it into Year-month bascially extract that data only from timestamp and save it.\ncategory is classified as <chr  >but categorical data,which has 4 different category. It need to be changed using as.factor().\namount has decimal point upto 10.

For example, for age_group 40-50yrs has more number of residents of household size 1 .\nBelow is small summary of the code\n\nThe count_table is created by counting the occurrences of each combination of age_group and householdSize in the resident_financial dataframe.\nCustom colors are defined using the scale_fill_manual function, providing a vector of color codes (custom_colors) to be used for filling the bars in the plot.\nThe plot is created using ggplot with count_table as the data. The geom_col function is used to create a bar plot with dodged bars for each age_group, with the householdSize determining the fill color.\nAdditional customizations are applied, such as setting the x-axis label, y-axis label, plot title, and theme.\nThe ggplot plot is then converted to an interactive plot using ggplotly, which enables interactive features such as hover tooltips and zooming.\nVarious customizations are applied to the interactive plot, including customizing the hover label appearance, legend labels, and axis labels and tick fonts.\nFinally, the interactive plot is displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Calculating count for each combination of age_group and householdSize\ncount_table <- resident_financial %>%\n  count(age_group, householdSize)\n\n# Using custom colors\ncustom_colors <- c(\"#E69F00\", \"#56B4E9\", \"#009E73\", \"#F0E442\", \"#0072B2\")\n\n# Plotting the columns\np <- ggplot(count_table, aes(x = age_group, y = n, fill = householdSize)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\", color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = custom_colors) +\n  labs(x = \"Age Group\", y = \"Count\", fill = \"Household Size\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Household Size within Age Groups\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"))\n\n# Converting ggplot to interactive plot using ggplotly\nplotly_plot <- ggplotly(p)\n\n# Using tooltip labels\nplotly_plot <- plotly_plot %>% \n  layout(hoverlabel = list(bgcolor = \"white\",\n                           font = list(color = \"black\",\n                                       family = \"Arial, sans-serif\"),\n                           align = \"auto\",\n                           namelength = -1,\n                           bordercolor = \"black\"))\n\n# Customizing legend labels\nplotly_plot <- plotly_plot %>% \n  layout(legend = list(\n    title = list(text = \"Household Size\"),\n    font = list(family = \"Arial, sans-serif\", size = 12),\n    bgcolor = \"white\",\n    bordercolor = \"black\",\n    borderwidth = 1\n  ))\n\n# Customizing axis labels and tick font\nplotly_plot <- plotly_plot %>% \n  layout(xaxis = list(title = \"Age Group\", tickfont = list(family = \"Arial, sans-serif\", size = 12)),\n         yaxis = list(title = \"Count of unique resident\", tickfont = list(family = \"Arial, sans-serif\", size = 12)))\n\n# Displaying the interactive plot\nplotly_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Comparing Education with Age using Boxplot\n\nEducation VS AgeCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe code chunk plot a boxplot comparing the age distribution across different education levels.

The chart is faceted by the haveKids variable, allowing for easy comparison between the two groups.By examining the chart, we can identify patterns and trends in participant distribution. For example, 355 participants doesnt have kids who are having education level HighSchoolorCollege , likewise 170 participants have kids who are doing the same edcutionlevel.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Count of unique participants for each combination of educationLevel and haveKids\nparticipant_count <- resident_financial %>%\n  group_by(educationLevel, haveKids) %>%\n  summarise(count = n_distinct(participantId), .groups = \"keep\")\n\n# Creating the stacked bar chart\nbarplot_chart <- ggplot(data = participant_count, aes(x = educationLevel, y = count, fill = haveKids)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Count of Unique Participants by Education Level and Have Kids\") +\n  labs(x = \"Education Level\", y = \"Number of Participants\") +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", alpha = 0.7, col = 'black') +\n  facet_grid(. ~ haveKids) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\nplotly_chart <- ggplotly(barplot_chart)\nplotly_chart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Analysis on EducationLevel and Totalwage\n\nCreate Sum_wages table that will have id, EducationLevel, total wage\n\n\nSum_wagesCheck\n\n\n\nsum_wages <- resident_financial %>%\n  group_by(participantId, educationLevel) %>%\n  summarise(total_wages = sum(Wage)) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\n\n\n\n# Display the data table\nDT::datatable(sum_wages, class= \"compact\", filter='top')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViolin Plot- EducationLevel VS TotalWage\n\n\nViolinCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe violin plot shows the spread and density of total wages for each education level category. The width of the violins represents the density, with wider areas indicating higher frequency of data points. The violins are grouped by education level, allowing for easy comparison of wage distributions between different education levels. Overall, the interactive violin plot provides a clear visualization of the distribution of total wages across education levels. It helps identify patterns, trends, and potential differences in wages based on education level. Further analysis can be performed to explore the relationships between education level, total wages, and other relevant variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Violin plot between EducationLevel and Totalwage\nviolin_plot <- ggplot(sum_wages, aes(x = educationLevel, y = total_wages, fill = educationLevel)) +\n  geom_violin(scale = \"width\", trim = FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_discrete() +\n  labs(title = \"Total Wages Distribution by Education Level\",\n       x = \"Education Level\",\n       y = \"Total Wages\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Converting the ggplot object to an interactive plotly object and displaying it\ninteractive_plot <- ggplotly(violin_plot)\n\ninteractive_plot\n\n\n\n\n\nAnova test between EducationLevel and TotalWages\n\n\nAnovaCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk conducts a non-parametric analysis of variance (ANOVA) test to examine the relationship between education level (independent variable) and total wages (dependent variable).\nThe ANOVA test assesses whether there are statistically significant differences in the mean total wages across different education levels. The p-value is a measure of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis of no difference in means. In this case, since the p-value is below the significance level of 0.05, we can conclude that there is strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\nOverall, the data analysis indicates that education level has a significant effect on total wages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nggbetweenstats(data = sum_wages,\n               x = educationLevel,\n               y = total_wages,\n               type = \"np\",\n               mean.ci = TRUE,\n               pairwise.comparisons = TRUE,\n               pairwise.display = \"s\",\n               p.adjust.method = \"fdr\",\n               messages = FALSE\n) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),\n        strip.text = element_text(size = 12),\n        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"lightgray\"),\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n      \n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5 Age Group vs Joviality\n\nJoviality vs Age_groupCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe x axis represents the joviality values, while the y axis represents the age groups. The fill and color aesthetics are set to age_group, resulting in the ridgelines being filled and colored based on the different age groups. The density ridgeline plot is created using the geom_density_ridges function, with a specified bandwidth of 0.05 and an alpha value of 0.6 to control the transparency of the ridgelines. The x-axis scale is adjusted using scale_x_continuous to show tick marks with evenly spaced values.From the plot, it seems that Joviality and age_group has not that much in common to analyze.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Density ridge plot between Joviality and age_group\nggplot(resident_financial, aes(x = joviality, y = age_group,fill = age_group,color = age_group)) +\ngeom_density_ridges(bandwidth = .05, alpha = .6) +\nscale_x_continuous( breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 5)) +\nlabs(title = \" Joviality values Across Age Groups\",\n) +\ntheme(legend.position = \"none\",axis.title.y = element_blank(),panel.grid.major = element_blank(),plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#e763fa\", color = \"#C7BAA7\"),\n  plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\", color = \"#333333\"),  \n) +\ntheme_minimal() -> plot\n# Displaying the plot\nplot\n\n\n\n\n\nAnova test for Jovality vs Age_group\n\n\nAnova testCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe p-value of 0.08 suggests that there is no significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in Joviality across different age groups. This may indicates that there might be a trend or some degree of association between Joviality and age_group, but it does not reach the level of statistical significance.\nTherefore, based on this analysis, we do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant relationship between Joviality and age_group. Further investigations or a larger sample size might be necessary to explore the potential relationship between these variables in more detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nggbetweenstats(data = resident_new,\n               x = age_group,\n               y = joviality,\n               type = \"np\",\n               mean.ci = TRUE,\n               pairwise.comparisons = TRUE,\n               pairwise.display = \"s\",\n               p.adjust.method = \"fdr\",\n               messages = FALSE\n) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),\n        strip.text = element_text(size = 12),\n        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"lightgray\"),\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n      \n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6 Relationship of HeatMap on various Coulmns\n\n# Calculate correlation matrix\ncor_matrix <- cor(resident_financial[, c(\"age\", \"joviality\", \"Education\", \"Food\", \"Recreation\", \"Shelter\", \"Wage\", \"RentAdjustment\")])\n\n# Print correlation matrix\nprint(cor_matrix)\n\n                       age   joviality Education       Food Recreation Shelter\nage             1.00000000 -0.07043452        NA  0.0364880         NA      NA\njoviality      -0.07043452  1.00000000        NA -0.4864067         NA      NA\nEducation               NA          NA         1         NA         NA      NA\nFood            0.03648800 -0.48640671        NA  1.0000000         NA      NA\nRecreation              NA          NA        NA         NA          1      NA\nShelter                 NA          NA        NA         NA         NA       1\nWage           -0.02698547 -0.28216492        NA  0.1325984         NA      NA\nRentAdjustment          NA          NA        NA         NA         NA      NA\n                      Wage RentAdjustment\nage            -0.02698547             NA\njoviality      -0.28216492             NA\nEducation               NA             NA\nFood            0.13259837             NA\nRecreation              NA             NA\nShelter                 NA             NA\nWage            1.00000000             NA\nRentAdjustment          NA              1\n\n\n\nHeat MapCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nBased on the correlation analysis conducted, no significant correlations were observed between these variables- Rent Adjustment, Shelter, Recreation, and Education and any of the other variables in the dataset. Therefore, in order to provide a comprehensive overview of the correlations, I have decided not to plot these variables in the correlation heatmap.\nIt is important to note that the lack of observed correlations does not necessarily imply that these variables are unrelated to the others. Other types of relationships or non-linear associations might exist, which could be explored further through additional analysis or modelling techniques.\nFor the variables that were included in the correlation plot, the following correlations were identified:\nAge and Joviality:\n\nThere is a weak negative correlation between age and joviality (-0.070), indicating that as age increases, joviality tends to decrease slightly.\n\nAge and Food:\n\n-There is a weak positive correlation between age and food (0.036), suggesting that as age increases, food consumption tends to increase slightly. - Joviality and Food:\n-   There is a moderate negative correlation between joviality and food (-0.486), indicating that as joviality increases, food consumption tends to decrease.\n\nFood and Wage:\n\nThere is a weak positive correlation between food and wage (0.133), suggesting that as food consumption increases, wage tends to increase slightly. These correlations provide insights into the relationships between these variables and can guide further analysis and decision-making within our project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Calculate correlation matrix on realted columns\ncor_matrix <- cor(resident_financial[, c(\"age\", \"joviality\", \"Food\", \"Wage\")])\n\n# Reshaping the correlation matrix to long format\ncor_matrix_long <- melt(cor_matrix)\n\n# Creating a heatmap\nheatmap_plot <- ggplot(data = cor_matrix_long, aes(x = Var2, y = Var1, fill = value)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\", size = 0.2) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"#4D79FF\", high = \"#FF4D4D\") +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"\", title = \"Correlation Matrix\", fill = \"Correlation\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12, angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1,face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(size = 12,face = \"bold\"),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 12),\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 12))\n\n\n# Converting ggplot object to plotly object\nplotly_obj <- ggplotly(heatmap_plot) %>%\n  layout(\n    title = \"Correlation Matrix\",\n    hovermode = \"closest\",\n    xaxis = list(tickfont = list(size = 10)),\n    yaxis = list(tickfont = list(size = 10)),\n    legend = list(font = list(10)),\n    margin = list(l = 80, r = 80, t = 80, b = 80),\n    hoverlabel = list(bgcolor = \"#FFF\", font = list(size = 10))\n  )\n\n# Display the heatmap\nplotly_obj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7 Relationship between EducationLevel and TotalAmount\n\nCalculating Total Amount for each ParticipantID\n\n\nTotal AmountDataTable\n\n\n\ntotal_amount <- resident_financial %>%\n  group_by(participantId, educationLevel) %>%\n  summarise(totalAmount = sum(Education + Shelter + Food + Wage + Recreation, na.rm = TRUE) - sum(RentAdjustment, na.rm = TRUE),\n            .groups = \"drop\")\n\n\n\n\nDT::datatable(total_amount, class= \"compact\", filter='top')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDensity Plot between EducationLevel and TotalAmount\n\n\nDensity PlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe density plot provides insights into the distribution of total savings among different education levels. The x-axis represents the total amount of savings, while the y-axis represents the density of participants at each savings level.\nFrom the plot, it can be observed that individuals with a bachelor’s degree have a higher concentration of savings compared to other education levels. The density curve for the bachelor’s education level peaks at a higher savings amount, indicating that a significant proportion of participants with a bachelor’s degree have accumulated more savings.\nOn the other hand, participants with lower education levels, such as high school or below, exhibit a lower density of savings. The density curve for these education levels shows a peak at lower savings amounts, suggesting that a majority of participants with lower education levels have savings below 50000.\nThis analysis suggests a positive correlation between education level and savings, with higher education levels generally associated with higher savings. It highlights the potential financial benefits of pursuing higher education, as individuals with higher education levels tend to accumulate more savings over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Creating the Density Plot\nplot <- ggplot(total_amount, aes(x = totalAmount, fill = educationLevel)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) +\n  labs(title = \"Salary Distribution by Education Level\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = seq(25000, 200000, 25000),  # Setting the range\n    limits = c(25000, 200000)\n  ) +\n  ylab(\"Density\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n# Plotting the interactive density plot\nplotly_chart <- ggplotly(plot)\n\nplotly_chart"

Limitations and Recommendations\n\nLimitations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nLimited variables: The analysis focuses on a specific set of variables and may not capture the full complexity of the relationship between household size and age group. Other relevant variables that could influence the relationship may not have been considered.\nData quality: The analysis assumes that the data used for the plot is accurate and representative. Any data errors, missing values, or biases in the data could impact the validity of the conclusions drawn.\nGeneralization: The findings and conclusions based on the analysis may not be generalizable to a larger population or different contexts. The analysis is specific to the dataset and participants included, and the results may not hold true for other populations or settings.\n\n\n\n\nRecommendations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nInclude additional variables: To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between household size and age group, it is recommended to consider other relevant variables such as income, occupation, or geographic location. These variables can provide additional insights and help uncover underlying factors influencing the relationship.\nStatistical tests: While visualizations provide initial insights, it is advisable to conduct statistical tests to determine the significance of relationships. Hypothesis testing, regression analysis, or other appropriate statistical methods can provide more robust evidence and quantify the strength of relationships.\nData validation: It is important to ensure the accuracy and quality of the data used for analysis. Conducting data validation checks, addressing missing values, and verifying the representativeness of the dataset can enhance the reliability of the findings.\nConsider diverse samples: To improve generalizability, it is recommended to include a diverse sample of participants from different demographics, socioeconomic backgrounds, and geographical locations. This can help capture variations and identify potential interactions between variables.\nLongitudinal analysis: Analyzing data over time can provide insights into trends and changes in the relationship between household size and age group. Longitudinal analysis can help identify patterns and determine the stability of relationships over time.\nInterpretation caution: When interpreting the findings, it is important to consider the limitations of the analysis and acknowledge potential confounding variables or alternative explanations. Drawing cautious and nuanced conclusions can prevent over generalization and ensure a more accurate understanding of the relationship between household size and age group."
