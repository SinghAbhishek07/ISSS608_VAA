Are participants with higher joviality more likely to spend or save money?\n\nThe city wants to use the information to help with its significant community development initiatives, particularly how to distribute a sizable grant for city renewal that it recently received it. This would make it possible for urban planners to concentrate their efforts on particular regions of the community to raise population merriment generally."

The range of IDs is from 0 to 1,010, indicating that there are no missing or duplicated IDs.\nhouseholdSize: The data contains three distinct household sizes: 1, 2, and 3. The most common household size is 2, followed by 1 and then 3. The proportions indicate that 33.3% of the households have a size of 1, 36.9% have a size of 2, and 29.8% have a size of 3.\nhaveKids: There are two distinct values: FALSE and TRUE. The majority of participants (70.2%) do not have kids, while 29.8% have kids.\nage: The data includes 43 distinct ages, ranging from 18 to 60. The mean age is approximately 39 years, with a standard deviation of 14.3. The 5th percentile is 20, the median is 39, and the 95th percentile is 58.\neducationLevel: There are four distinct education levels: Bachelors, Graduate, HighSchoolOrCollege, and Low. The majority of participants (51.9%) have a HighSchoolOrCollege education level, followed by Bachelors (22.9%), Graduate (16.8%), and Low (8.3%).\ninterestGroup: There are 10 distinct interest groups labeled from A to J. The frequencies and proportions indicate the distribution of participants across these interest groups.\njoviality: Joviality is a numeric variable ranging from 0 to 1. The mean joviality score is approximately 0.494, with a standard deviation of 0.3364. The 5th percentile is 0.05642, the median is 0.47754, and the 95th percentile is 0.96024.\n\n\n\n\nChanging Data Types:\n\nparticipantId is classified as <dbl>, numerical continuous data, instead of nominal. This is cast as <chr> class using as.factor()\nhouseholdSize is classified as <dbl>, but categorical in nature with different levels. This is cast as <chr> class using `as.factor()\neducationLevel is classified as <chr  > categorical data,which has 4 different category.

The participant ID ranges from 0 to 1,010. .\nTimestamp: The financial data spans a time period from March 1, 2022, to February 28, 2023. The timestamp variable shows the date and time of each financial transaction. .\nCategory: There are six distinct categories in the financial data, including Education, Food, Recreation, RentAdjustment, Shelter, and Wage. The most frequent category is Food, accounting for approximately 52.2% of the transactions, followed by Recreation (19.6%) and Wage (27.3%).\nAmount: The amount variable represents the monetary value of each transaction. The mean amount is 20.05, indicating an average transaction value. The range of the amounts is from -1562.726 to 4096.526, with a wide distribution. The majority of the amounts fall within the range of -21.050 to 159.561.\n\n\n\n\nChanging Data Types:\n\nparticipantId is classified as <dbl>, numerical continuous data, instead of nominal. This is cast as <chr> class using as.factor()\ntimestamp has a big value contains date and time both, which is not required for our anaylsis. So i will change it into Year-month bascially extract that data only from timestamp and save it.\ncategory is classified as <chr  >but categorical data,which has 4 different category. It need to be changed using as.factor().\namount has decimal point upto 10. It will be rounded upto 2 for readability and easily computation.\n\n\n\nChanging data typeChecking the changes\n\n\n\nfinancial_new <- financial %>%\n  mutate(\n\n# Changing participantId to nominal\nparticipantId = as.factor(participantId),\n\n# Extracting Year-Month from timestamp\ntimestamp = format(as.Date(timestamp), \"%Y-%m\"),\n\n# Changing category to factor\ncategory = as.factor(category),\n\n# Rounding amount to 2 decimal places\namount = round(amount, 2)\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n# Check the data types of variables\nstr(financial_new)\n\ntibble [1,513,636 × 4] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ participantId: Factor w/ 1011 levels \"0\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",..: 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 ...\n $ timestamp    : chr [1:1513636] \"2022-03\" \"2022-03\" \"2022-03\" \"2022-03\" ...\n $ category     : Factor w/ 6 levels \"Education\",\"Food\",..: 6 5 1 6 5 1 6 5 1 6 ...\n $ amount       : num [1:1513636] 2473 -555 -38 2047 -555 ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDivide Category into new columns and count Total Amount for each category\n\n\nCategory’sChecking the changes\n\n\n\nfinancial_new <- financial_new %>%\n  group_by(participantId, timestamp, category) %>%\n  summarise(total_amount = sum(amount), .groups = \"drop\") %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = category, values_from = total_amount)\n\nThe code chunk groups the data by participantId, timestamp, and category, calculates the sum of amount for each group, and then reshapes the data to have separate columns for each category, with the corresponding total_amount values. The resulting data frame is assigned to financial_new.The pivot_wider() function is used to reshape the data frame from a long format to a wide format. It takes the distinct category values as column names and populates the corresponding total_amount values for each participantId and timestamp combination.\n\n\n\nDT::datatable(financial_new, class= \"compact\", filter='top')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Joining the Tables\nWe have 2 dataset resident_new with columns participantId, householdSize, haveKids, age, educationLevel,interestGroup, joviality, age_group and financial_new with columns `participantId, timestamp,Education ,Food, Recreation, Shelter, Wage, RentAdjustment.\n\nJoin TableCheck Table\n\n\n\nresident_financial <- left_join(resident_new, financial_new, by = \"participantId\")\n\nThe code chunk will create a new data frame resident_financial that combines the columns from both tables based on matching participantId values.

This is cast as <chr  > class using as.character()\n\n\ncategory * is classified as <chr  >, but is categorical in nature with six different levels.

For the purpose of this study, we assume that the closer the score is to 1 (maximum), the more jovial the participant was recorded at the start of the survey. Joviality will thus be analysed across different demographic and financial variables, to find significant patterns and trends.\n\n3.1.1: Distribution\nThe distribution of joviality scores is first visualised to determine the variation of values across the sample population:\n\n#  | warning: false\n\n#  | fig-width: 8\n\n#mean_jov   <- mean(df_combined  $joviality)\n\n#std_jov   <-\n\nggplot(df_combined, aes(x = joviality)) +\n\ngeom_histogram(bins = 15,\n\ncolor = \"#F8F3E6\") +\n\n#stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = mean_jov, sd = std_jov), col=\"#93c7c2\", size = .7)+\n\nscale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10),\n\nlimits = c(0,1)) +\n\ngeom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(joviality)),\n\ncolour=\"#f53b5d\", linewidth = 0.8, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n\ngeom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(joviality)),\n\ncolour=\"grey40\", linewidth = 0.8, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n\nlabs(x = \"Joviality Score\",\n\ny = NULL) +\n\ntheme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n\nplot.background = element_rect(fill=\"#F8F3E6\",colour=\"#F8F3E6\"))\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_bar()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mean < span > joviality score is close to the median < span >, suggesting that joviality resembles a normal distribution.\n\n\n3.1.2: * Are there differences in Joviality Scores Across Income and Age Groups? *\nWe seek to find out if specific groups within the population have reported lower or higher joviality scores, and if this difference between factor levels in the sample is significant enough to represent the overall city population.\nA normality assumption test is first conducted across factor levels for joviality score across income and age groups.

In fact, there is a large difference in mean joviality between low income and high income groups, * with participants in low income groups having greater joviality (median = 0.75) than higher income groups (median = 0.23). *\n\n\n\n\nAge Groups *\n\n\nDistributionNormality TestANOVA\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf_combined %>%\n\ngroup_by(ageGroup) %>%\n\nshapiro_test(joviality) %>%\n\nungroup() %>%\n\nkbl() %>%\n\nkable_styling(full_width = F, bootstrap_options = \"responsive\")\n\n\n\n \n  \n    ageGroup \n    variable \n    statistic \n    p \n  \n \n\n  \n    18-29 \n    joviality \n    0.9502827 \n    1e-07 \n  \n  \n    30-39 \n    joviality \n    0.9384257 \n    0e+00 \n  \n  \n    40-50 \n    joviality \n    0.9526016 \n    2e-07 \n  \n  \n    51-60 \n    joviality \n    0.9519616 \n    6e-07 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nSince the p-value across each age group is < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, concluding that joviality does not follow a normal distribution across age groups either. To test if there is a significant difference between groups, a non-parametric test will be used in subsequent analysis.\n\n\nA non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA test is conducted to determine if there is a significant difference in mean joviality score between age groups.
